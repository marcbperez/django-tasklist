# django-tasklist

Task list service for Django.

## Installation

This projects uses Gradle (at least version 3.3) as its build system along with
a Docker and docker-compose wrapper for continuous development. On Debian Linux
distributions Gradle can be installed with the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cwchien/gradle
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install default-jdk gradle=3.4-0ubuntu1
```

If you prefer to install Docker and docker-compose (highly recommended) refer to
the [official instructions][install-docker-compose].

## Usage

To start the service get the project and install its dependencies. Once the
migrations have successfully been applied, run the development server
at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcbperez/django-tasklist
cd django-tasklist
sudo gradle dependencies
gradle install
gradle makeMigrations
gradle migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

To add this service module, start by declaring it in `settings.py` and include
the module's URL configuration in `urls.py`.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'tasklist',
]
```

```python
urlpatterns = [
    ...
    url(r'^tasklist/', include('tasklist.urls')),
]
```

## Testing

Tests will be executed by default every time the project is built. To run them
manually start a new build or use Gradle's test task. For a complete list of
tasks check `gradle tasks --all`.

```bash
gradle test
```

A continuous build cycle can be executed with `gradle --continuous` inside a
virtual environment, or with Docker.

```
sudo docker-compose up
```
