django-tasklist
===============

Task list service for Django.

Installation
------------

This projects uses Gradle (at least version 3.3) as its build system
along with a Docker and docker-compose wrapper for continuous
development. On Debian Linux distributions Gradle can be installed with
the following commands:

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cwchien/gradle
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install default-jdk gradle=3.4-0ubuntu1

If you prefer to install Docker and docker-compose (highly recommended)
refer to the `official
instructions <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`__.

Usage
-----

To start the service get the project and install its dependencies. Once
the migrations have successfully been applied, run the development
server at ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/``.

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/marcbperez/django-tasklist
    cd django-tasklist
    sudo gradle dependencies
    gradle install
    gradle makeMigrations
    gradle migrate
    python manage.py runserver

To add this service module, start by declaring it in ``settings.py`` and
include the module's URL configuration in ``urls.py``.

.. code:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'tasklist',
    ]

.. code:: python

    urlpatterns = [
        ...
        url(r'^tasklist/', include('tasklist.urls')),
    ]

Testing
-------

Tests will be executed by default every time the project is built. To
run them manually start a new build or use Gradle's test task. For a
complete list of tasks check ``gradle tasks --all``.

.. code:: bash

    gradle test

A continuous build cycle can be executed with ``gradle --continuous``
inside a virtual environment, or with Docker.

::

    sudo docker-compose up
